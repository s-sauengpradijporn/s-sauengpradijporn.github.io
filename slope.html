  <h1> <font color="white">Slope Intercept Form</font></h1>
 <p><font color="black"> In equation of straight line(when the equation is written as "y=mx+b"), The slope is the number 
 "m" that is multiplied on the x, and "b" is the y-intercept, where the y-axis. This useful form of the line equation 
 is sensibly named the "slope intercept form."</font></p>
