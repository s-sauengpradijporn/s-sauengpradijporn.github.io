  <h1> <font color="white">Slope Intercept Form!</font></h1>
 <p class= "Dotum"> In equation of straight line(when the equation is written as "y=mx+b"), The slope is the number 
 "m" that is multiplied on the x, and "b" is the y-intercept, where the y-axis. This useful form of the line equation 
 is sensibly named the "slope intercept form." One of the most important things to understand about lines is the definition of slope. Slope is the 'steepness' of the line, also commonly known as rise over run. We can calculate slope by dividing the change in the x-value 
  between two points over the change in the y-value. In order to understand the importance of the definition of slope, one should understand how to interpret
  graphs and how to write an equation. </p>
