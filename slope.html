 <p><front color="black> In equation of straight line(when the equation is written as "y=mx+b"), the slope is the number 
 "m" that is multiplied on the x, and "b" is the y-intercept, where the y-axis. This useful form of the line equation 
 is sensibly named the "slope intercept form".</font></p>
